Java JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java programs to interact with databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable developers to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, retrieve and manipulate data, and manage transactions.

JDBC follows a standardized architecture known as the "Java Database Connectivity API," which consists of the following key components:

 - DriverManager: This class manages the JDBC drivers. It allows you to register and unregister drivers and establish a connection to a database.

 - Connection: This interface represents a connection to a specific database. It provides methods for creating statements, managing transactions, and closing the connection.

 - Statement: This interface represents a SQL statement that is sent to the database and executed. It can be used for executing queries and updates.

 - ResultSet: This interface represents the result of a query execution. It provides methods for navigating through the result set, retrieving data from the columns, and performing operations on the data.
